## Todos
- [ ] benchmark a undo function vs using passing by value to clone the positin in perft
- [ ] ptn moves should not include the drop count on the original square
- [ ] parse ptn moves
- [x] perft count seems wrong, test against https://github.com/ViliamVadocz/tak/blob/main/tak/tests/perft.rs
- [ ] rework the tps loading to be both more flexible and more compliant
  - [ ] check for input legality as well?
- [ ] test `unsigned __int128`, both in https://www.chessprogramming.org/10x12_Board and in the stacks to avoid overflows in the `8s`
