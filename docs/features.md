  - [x] game endings
    - [x] routes
    - [x] ties
      - [x] no more pieces
      - [x] full board
    - [x] dragon clause

    - [x] ptn moves
      - [x] moves to

- [ ] engine
  - [ ] search
    - [ ] minimax with alpha-beta pruning
    - [ ] monte carlo
    - [ ] threaded
    - [x] transposition table
      - [x] hashmap
      - [x] hash
        - [x] zobrist
      - [x] rotations
        - [x] rotate index
        - [x] incremental rotation: i have 8 positions, each for one rotation, and i update all of them at the same time. In the tt i can save just the "original" one and, at lookup, search for every hash.
          - pros: faster
          - cons: 4x space used
          - maybe i can only save 8 zobrist hash, and update them with the indexes rotated

## Todos
- [ ] test `unsigned __int128`, both in https://www.chessprogramming.org/10x12_Board and in the stacks to avoid overflows in the `8s`
- [ ] solve empty buckets in full hashmap
- [ ] test collisions in zobrist and find a good (?) seed
- [ ] test having static larger buckets and no probing (like stockfish) in the tt
