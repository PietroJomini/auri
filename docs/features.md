- [ ] opening db
- [ ] engine
  - [ ] search
    - [ ] minimax with alpha-beta pruning
    - [ ] monte carlo
    - [ ] threaded
    - [ ] transposition table
      - [x] hashmap
      - [ ] hash
        - [x] zobrist
        - [ ] test collisions
      - [ ] rotations
        - [ ] incremental rotation: i have 8 positions, each for one rotation, and i update all of them at the same time
          - pros: faster
          - cons: 4x space used
          - maybe i can only save 8 zobrist hash, and update them with the indexes rotated
  - [ ] evaluation

        - [ ] find potential roads

- [ ] solve empty buckets in full hashmap
