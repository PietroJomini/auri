## Todos
- [x] benchmark a undo function vs using passing by value to clone the positin in perft
  - it's way faster to abuse c and clone the position each time (let's gooo)
  - maybe i can optimize my poor undo_slide by saving some "undo" date in the "do", but it's probably not worth
- [x] ptn moves should not include the drop count on the original square
- [x] parse ptn moves
- [x] perft count seems wrong, test against https://github.com/ViliamVadocz/tak/blob/main/tak/tests/perft.rs
- [ ] test `unsigned __int128`, both in https://www.chessprogramming.org/10x12_Board and in the stacks to avoid overflows in the `8s`
